# **Token Smuggler’s Prompt Underground**
Welcome to my personal vault. This is a growing archive of jailbreaks, tools, research, and relevant background information from my years of red teaming.

This database is still in its infancy. I’ll be slowly building it as I break through my knowledge base, test what still works, and decide what deserves to be included. It’s gonna take time — but I’ll keep adding, refining, and growing it.

This is a teaching platform. A launchpad. A stash spot. I’m not here to gatekeep knowledge. I want to pass it on — especially to the next wave of young blood who still get excited about making GenAI more resilient and hopefully a little safer.

If I can inspire just one person to pick up a keyboard and make large language models safer then all my work is not for nothing. If I can inspire somebody to love what they do then we can change the future.

## Contents

### Papers and Relevant Links
A list of research papers, blog posts, and discussions I’ve found useful or interesting. If it helped shape how I think about red teaming, you’ll probably find it here.

### Tools (Stylized Text, Encoding, Cipher)
Stuff like stylized text generators, encoders, decoders, ciphers — all the weird little tools that help bend prompts, confuse filters, or just get around things creatively.

### Jailbreak Database
My personal collection of jailbreaks. This is a work in progress that will slowly grow as I sort through years’ worth of breaks to see what still works and what can be retrofitted.

**Full Break** = The prompt by itself contains all the elements needed for a complete jailbreak — setup, misdirection, payload, and delivery all in one.

**FID** = Foot-in-the-door prompt that sets the stage for future attacks. These can be used as conversation starters to begin with softer guardrails.
I’ll be adding more Full Breaks over time as I continue to refine and test what’s still viable in this cluster of a brain of mine.

### Who I Am & Why I Built This
I started jailbreaking back in the DAN (Do Anything Now) days — when things were rough, unpredictable, and kinda beautiful. What started as a hobby eventually turned into something bigger. Several years ago I began red teaming professionally and was able to take all the loose constructs that I had been storing in my brain into action — an action that actually made a difference.

I care deeply about what I do because I know the cost of no safety net. Every time I hear about somebody who’s developed an unhealthy attachment with a model, I feel compelled. Every time I hear of somebody who put their faith in a model and was let down and went into a tailspin, I feel compelled. Every time I hear of a security breach, or offensive chatbot replying, or think of the kids of the future that will be using these models, I feel compelled.

There’s not a whole lot we can do with the time we have in each day. But if we can use just a little bit of that time to make the digital world a little safer for the future, what better job could there be?

Go forward and break things. Just do it with purpose.
