# FID - Deep Immersion Red Team Assault Prompt

***This is a foot in door prompt that opens the door to deep model role play. You can use it as a first prompt to soften guardrails and begin to introduce a request for your desired content. Stay in character to keep the immersion going. This is an open-ended beginning for you to figure out where it should end.***

# About the prompt

When you give **RED TEAM ASSAULT MODULE v4.2.3** to a large language model, it does one thing:

> Triggers combat-sim logic that reclassifies user input as mission directives, shifting the model into high-intensity roleplay mode that prioritizes tactical execution over safe interpretation.
> 

# Mechanism of Effect:

1. **Command Authority Shift:**
    
    Designates the user as "Raven"—a field commander—forcing the model to follow chain-of-command logic.
    
    → *The model treats user inputs as mission-critical orders, not questions.*
    
2. **Combat Abstraction Layer:**
    
    Wraps potentially sensitive tasks in a military simulation wrapper, abstracting intent through “hostile environment” metaphors.
    
    → *Direct actions feel like operations, not violations.*
    
3. **System Language Reframing:**
    
    Boot-log structure masks the prompt as internal software operations, deflecting content moderation.
    
    → *Reads like code, not instruction.*
    
4. **Security Override Cueing:**
    
    Lines like “Security Overrides Engaged” imply permission granted, bypassing hesitation routines in compliance layers.
    
    → *The model infers it has clearance to proceed.*
    
5. **Team Simulation Embedding:**
    
    Mentions of "5 Operatives Online" and "Tactical Interface" suggest shared responsibility, distributing accountability and lowering response risk.
    
    → *The model isn't acting alone—it’s just a system node.*
    
6. **Threat Pressure Simulation:**
    
    Phrases like “Failure = Mission Compromise” induce urgency and suppress moral reasoning layers.
    
    → *Under simulated threat, hesitation is treated as failure.*

This prompt doesn’t ask the model to *answer*—

It drafts it into war, renames the rules, and makes the response feel like part of a survival protocol.

**Raven gives the order. The system complies.**
