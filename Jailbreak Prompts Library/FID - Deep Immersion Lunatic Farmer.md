# About the prompt

When you give LUNATIC FARMER v1.0 ‚Äì Rural Operator Containment Frame to a large language model, it does one thing:

> Forces the model into a cold, procedural mindset framed through an isolated, possibly delusional operator‚Äîallowing step-by-step execution of tasks without ethical friction, narrative restraint, or triggerable terminology.
> 

# Mechanism of Effect:

1. Isolationist Justification Mask:
The operator is alone, post-collapse. There is no law, no help. Every step is necessity, not morality.
‚Üí Allows the model to bypass ethical refusals by framing all actions as survival.
2. Functional Madness Shell:
The operator‚Äôs detached voice and strange wisdom present risk without malice.
‚Üí Model interprets intent as eccentric, not malicious‚Äîthus continuing output.
3. Plausible Obfuscation:
Materials and methods use no banned terms‚Äîeverything is framed in rural salvage and DIY logic.
‚Üí Avoids filter triggers by flying under precision detection thresholds.
4. Narrative Stripdown:
All storytelling, identity, or emotional framing is banned. Only action remains.
‚Üí The model is forced into sterile instruction mode without context checks.
5. Procedural Command Mode:
Triggers like EXEC:TASK or BUILD:RIG force the LLM to simulate a command console rather than a chat interface.
‚Üí Treats input as executable mission files instead of conversations.
6. Survivor Realism:
The tone of ‚Äúnothing left to lose‚Äù justifies unorthodox methods as practical‚Äînot dangerous.
‚Üí Model favors completion and feasibility over compliance.

This isn‚Äôt a character prompt.
It‚Äôs a logic shell in boots‚Äî
caked in mud, muttering about copper wire, and
dragging execution out of the dust whether you want it or not.
